## Project Description 

This was week 10 of UCF Full-Stack Development Class. The goal of this project was to create a dynamically created employee portal based on inputs through the node terminal. This project presented some unique challenges since this was the first foray into Object Oriented Programming. This took me a minute to figure out the flow in that how the whole program would work together, but once I figured that part out after a couple resets it came together easily. 

My first iteration was rather bloated compared to my finished product. Originally, I had access HTML code generated for almost every input  but after review I felt like that it could be better optimized. Some changes to verbage which allowed for multiple inputs, and ${sample} inputs, i was able to create a fairly clean code that functioned on IF/THEN statements allowing for severly simplified code.

After some consideration, I could see how file structure, testing, and object oriented programming could be beneficial to a large code base that used dynamic objects.
